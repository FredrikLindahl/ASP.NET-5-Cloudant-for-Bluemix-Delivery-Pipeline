# How to set up an ASP.NET 5 Continuous Delivery Pipeline using IBM Bluemix DevOps Services

This project contains a simple HelloWorld ASP.NET 5 application with basic CRUD functionality using a Cloudant NoSQL database. The project was created during the making of a how-to-guide on how to use the IBM DevOps Services Delivery Pipeline for building, testing and deploying ASP.NET 5 applications to Bluemix. Use the button below to deploy the complete application as-is to your Bluemix account.

## Setup the IBM DevOps Services Delivery Pipeline for this project

In this presentation we explain how to set up a complete IBM native tool chain for Continuous Delivery by using the IBM DevOps Services Build & Deploy function, also known as the Delivery Pipeline. We develop, build, (autonomously) unit test, integration test, load test and deploy an ASP.NET 5 application with a Cloudant NoSQL database to Bluemix.
