# How to set up an ASP.NET 5 Continuous Delivery Pipeline using IBM Bluemix DevOps Services

In this presentation we explain how to set up a complete IBM native tool chain for Continuous Delivery by using the IBM DevOps Services Build & Deploy function, also known as the Delivery Pipeline. We develop, build, (autonomously) unit test, integration test, load test and deploy an ASP.NET 5 application with a Cloudant NoSQL database to Bluemix.
